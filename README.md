# create readme file for this app

Sure! Here is a README file tailored for your Streamlit "Student Pass/Fail Predictor" app, including both the model training and prediction parts:

```markdown
# Student Pass/Fail Predictor

This is a simple machine learning-based web app built with Streamlit to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their study hours and attendance percentage.

---

## Project Overview

This app uses logistic regression to classify student outcomes as **Pass** or **Fail**, by analyzing two main features:

- **Study Hours** per day
- **Attendance** percentage

The app provides an interactive UI to input these values and predict the result with confidence scores.

---

## Features

- Simple logistic regression model trained on sample data
- Interactive Streamlit UI with sliders for input
- Displays prediction with confidence level
- Easily extensible to add more features or use your own dataset

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Install required libraries:

```

pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib

```

### Files

- `train_student_pass_predictor.py` — trains the classification model and saves `student_pass_predictor_model.pkl`
- `student_pass_predictor.py` — Streamlit app that loads the trained model and runs prediction with user input

---

## How to Run

### Step 1: Train the Model (only once or when data changes)

```

python train_student_pass_predictor.py

```

This generates the model file `student_pass_predictor_model.pkl` used by the app.

### Step 2: Launch the Streamlit App

```

streamlit run student_pass_predictor.py

```

### Step 3: Use the App

- Adjust the sliders to input Study Hours per day and Attendance (%).
- Click **Predict** to see whether the student is likely to pass or fail, along with the confidence score.

---

## Dataset

The model is trained on a small sample dataset included in `train_student_pass_predictor.py`:

| StudyHours | Attendance | Pass (Target) |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 60         | 0 (Fail)      |
| 2          | 65         | 0 (Fail)      |
| ...        | ...        | ...           |
| 6.5        | 96         | 1 (Pass)      |

Feel free to replace the dataset with your own data and retrain the model accordingly.

## Customization and Improvements

- Add more features like assignment scores, project grades, etc.
- Experiment with different classifiers and hyperparameters.
- Improve dataset size and quality for better accuracy.
- Add more detailed evaluation metrics.
